# Telegram Bot на Replit с Keep-Alive

## Overview

This is a 24/7 Telegram bot designed to run on the Replit platform. The project provides a simple, user-friendly way to create and deploy a Telegram bot without requiring extensive programming knowledge. The bot includes basic command handling, message processing, and a keep-alive mechanism to ensure continuous operation on Replit's free tier.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

**Modular Design**: The application follows a clean separation of concerns with distinct modules:
- `bot.py`: Contains the core Telegram bot logic and command handlers
- `config.py`: Manages configuration and environment variables with validation
- `keep_alive.py`: Implements a Flask web server for health monitoring
- `main.py`: Orchestrates the entire application and manages threading

**Multi-threaded Architecture**: The system uses Python threading to run two main components concurrently:
- Main thread: Runs the Telegram bot using python-telegram-bot library
- Background thread: Runs a Flask web server for keep-alive functionality

**Environment-based Configuration**: All sensitive data (bot tokens) are managed through environment variables, following security best practices for cloud deployment.

**Error Handling and Logging**: Comprehensive logging system throughout all modules with structured error messages and user-friendly configuration validation.

### Bot Framework

**Telegram Bot API Integration**: Uses the `python-telegram-bot` library for handling Telegram API interactions, providing:
- Command handlers for `/start`, `/help`, `/status`, and `/info` commands
- Message handlers for general text processing
- Asynchronous operation support for better performance

**Keep-Alive Mechanism**: Implements a Flask web server that serves as a health check endpoint, preventing Replit from putting the application to sleep due to inactivity.

### Deployment Strategy

**Replit-Optimized**: The architecture is specifically designed for Replit's hosting environment:
- Uses Replit's Secrets feature for secure token storage
- Implements keep-alive server to maintain 24/7 operation
- Includes dependency management through pip requirements

**Single-File Deployment**: While modular in development, the application can be easily deployed by copying files to a Replit project, making it accessible for non-technical users.

## External Dependencies

**Telegram Bot API**: Core integration with Telegram's Bot API for message handling and bot operations.

**Python Libraries**:
- `python-telegram-bot`: Primary library for Telegram bot functionality
- `flask`: Web server framework for the keep-alive mechanism
- `threading`: Built-in Python library for concurrent execution

**Replit Platform Services**:
- Replit Secrets: Secure storage for the bot token
- Replit Hosting: Cloud hosting environment with automatic deployment
- Replit Console: For dependency installation and management

**BotFather Integration**: Requires initial setup through Telegram's @BotFather bot to obtain the necessary bot token and configuration.
